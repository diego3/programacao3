	<h1> The basic building blocks of Angular applications.</h1>


	<p>
	Angular is a framework for building client applications in HTML and either JavaScript or a language like TypeScript that compiles to JavaScript.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The framework consists of several libraries, some of them core and some optional.
	</p>

	<p>
	You write Angular applications by composing HTML templates with Angularized markup, writing component classes to manage those templates, adding application logic in services, and boxing components and services in modules.
	</p>

	<p>
	Then you launch the app by bootstrapping the root module. Angular takes over, presenting your application content in a browser and responding to user interactions according to the instructions you've provided.
	</p>

	<p>
	Of course, there is more to it than this. You'll learn the details in the pages that follow. For now, focus on the big picture.
